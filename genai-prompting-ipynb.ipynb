Like Siri or Alexa!\n    * **Playing games:**  AI can learn to play games, even really complicated ones like chess or video games, and sometimes they can even get really, really good!\n    * **Helping you find things:**  When you search for something on the internet, AI helps the computer find the best websites for you!\n\n* **How does it learn?**  Imagine you show your puppy a treat every time it sits.  It learns that sitting means treat!  AI learns by being shown lots and lots and lots of examples.  Like showing it millions of pictures of cats to learn what a cat looks like.  It's like giving the computer lots of information and letting it figure out the patterns.\n\n* **Is it magic?** No, it's not magic!  It's clever computer programs written by smart people.  But it can seem a little bit like magic sometimes because it can do things that seem really smart!\n\n**So, AI is like a super smart computer program that can learn, think a little bit, and help us with lots of things!**  It's still learning and getting better all the time, just like you when you go to school!

For millennia, it has been a cornerstone of civilizations, particularly in the Mediterranean basin, weaving itself into the fabric of culture, cuisine, and economy. While often perceived as a traditional staple, olives are far from relics of the past. In modern society, their importance is not only sustained but amplified, extending far beyond mere culinary delight.  From their profound impact on global health and sustainable agriculture to their burgeoning role in the beauty and wellness industries, olives are a vital, multifaceted resource that continues to shape our world in profound and often understated ways.\n\nOne of the most significant contributions of olives to modern society is undeniably in the realm of health and nutrition.  The Mediterranean diet, with olive oil as its liquid gold heart, has become globally recognized as a paradigm of healthy eating.  Decades of scientific research have consistently lauded the health benefits of olive oil, primarily due to its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic acid, and a wealth of antioxidants like polyphenols and vitamin E. These compounds work synergistically to combat inflammation, reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, lower bad cholesterol (LDL) while raising good cholesterol (HDL), and even offer protection against certain cancers.  In an era grappling with rising rates of chronic diseases linked to processed foods and sedentary lifestyles, the emphasis on olive oil as a healthy fat source is more crucial than ever. Modern dietary guidelines, from the World Health Organization to national health bodies, consistently recommend incorporating olive oil into daily diets, solidifying its importance in public health strategies aimed at promoting well-being and longevity.\n\nBeyond olive oil, table olives themselves offer a nutritional punch. Fermented olives are rich in probiotics, contributing to gut health and boosting the immune system, a factor increasingly appreciated in modern wellness trends. They are also a source of fiber, minerals like iron and copper, and vitamins.  In a society increasingly conscious of mindful eating and plant-based diets, olives provide a flavorful and versatile ingredient. They are no longer confined to antipasto platters; they are being incorporated into innovative dishes, from tapenades and salads to pizzas and even desserts, adding a salty, briny depth of flavor and nutritional value to modern cuisine.  The global fascination with fermentation and gut health further elevates the importance of olives, positioning them not just as a traditional food but as a functional food with tangible health benefits that resonate with contemporary health-conscious consumers.\n\nEconomically, the olive industry plays a substantial role on a global scale.  Olive cultivation and olive oil production are significant economic drivers, particularly for Mediterranean countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia, where olive groves are not just agricultural landscapes but integral parts of national identity and cultural heritage.  The olive oil industry provides livelihoods for millions, from farmers and harvesters to millers, bottlers, distributors, and retailers.  Modernization in olive farming techniques, while sometimes debated for its environmental impact, has also led to increased efficiency and production, allowing olive oil to reach wider global markets.  The demand for high-quality extra virgin olive oil, recognized for its superior flavor and health benefits, is constantly growing, driving innovation and investment in the sector.  Furthermore, the table olive industry, with its diverse varieties and preparations, is a significant export commodity for many olive-producing regions, contributing to international trade and economic growth.\n\nBeyond the traditional Mediterranean heartlands, olive cultivation is expanding globally.  Countries like Australia, the United States (California), and South Africa are increasingly investing in olive farming, driven by the growing global demand and the recognition of olives as a sustainable and resilient crop in certain climates.  This geographical diversification of olive production enhances food security and strengthens the global olive industry, making it less reliant on specific regions and vulnerable to localized disruptions.  The modernization of the olive industry, embracing technological advancements in harvesting, processing, and packaging, ensures its continued economic viability and its ability to meet the ever-increasing global demand.\n\nThe importance of olives extends beyond the tangible realms of health and economy into the less quantifiable, yet equally significant, sphere of culture and tradition.  For millennia, the olive tree has been a symbol of peace, wisdom, and prosperity.  The olive branch, famously carried by doves, is a universal emblem of peace, deeply ingrained in collective consciousness.  In mythology and religion, olives are revered; in ancient Greece, Athena gifted the olive tree to Athens, and in the Bible, the olive tree is mentioned numerous times, symbolizing abundance and divine favor.  This rich cultural heritage continues to resonate in modern society.  Olive groves are not just agricultural landscapes; they are living museums, imbued with history and tradition.  Olive oil production is often passed down through generations, representing family heritage and regional identity.  The act of sharing bread dipped in olive oil, or enjoying olives as part of a communal meal, remains a powerful social ritual, fostering connection and conviviality in an increasingly fast-paced and fragmented world.\n\nFurthermore, olives are increasingly finding their place in modern beauty and wellness trends.  Olive oil, rich in antioxidants and moisturizing properties, is a popular ingredient in skincare and haircare products.  From soaps and lotions to serums and hair masks, olive oil is celebrated for its natural emollient and rejuvenating qualities.  In a society increasingly seeking natural and sustainable beauty solutions, olive oil offers a gentle and effective alternative to synthetic chemicals.  The “clean beauty” movement further elevates the importance of olive oil, recognizing its natural origin, minimal processing, and beneficial properties for skin and hair health.  This expands the reach of olives beyond the culinary and nutritional domains, positioning them as a versatile ingredient in the burgeoning wellness industry.\n\nFinally, and perhaps crucially for the future, the importance of olives in modern society is intertwined with the growing awareness of sustainable agriculture and environmental consciousness.  Olive trees are remarkably resilient and drought-tolerant, making them well-suited to arid and semi-arid climates, regions increasingly impacted by climate change.  Traditional olive farming practices, often characterized by low-input and rain-fed cultivation, are inherently sustainable.  While intensive olive farming, driven by market demands, can pose environmental challenges like water depletion and soil erosion, there is a growing movement towards sustainable olive cultivation.  Organic olive farming, agroforestry practices incorporating olive trees, and water-efficient irrigation techniques are gaining traction, aiming to minimize the environmental footprint of olive production.  In a world grappling with the urgent need for sustainable food systems, olives, when cultivated responsibly, offer a model for environmentally sound agriculture, providing food, economic opportunities, and cultural heritage while respecting ecological limits.\n\nIn conclusion, the importance of olives in modern society is far-reaching and multifaceted.  From their undeniable contribution to global health and nutrition, particularly through olive oil’s role in the Mediterranean diet, to their significant economic impact on producing regions and the expanding global market, olives are a vital resource.  Beyond the tangible benefits, their rich cultural heritage, symbolic significance, and burgeoning role in beauty and wellness industries further solidify their relevance.  Crucially, in an era demanding sustainable solutions, olives, when cultivated responsibly, represent a resilient and environmentally sound agricultural crop.  The enduring green of the olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity for millennia, continues to offer nourishment, economic opportunity, and cultural richness, firmly cementing its importance in the complex and evolving tapestry of modern society. As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, the humble olive, with its multifaceted contributions, remains a vital and enduring resource, deserving of continued appreciation and sustainable cultivation for generations to come.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Greedy Decoding\nGreedy decoding is a simple and fast method used in natural language generation (like in large language models or machine translation) to generate text one token at a time.\n\n### How It Works\nAt each step in generation:\n\nThe model predicts a probability distribution over the next possible tokens.\n\nGreedy decoding picks the token with the highest probability.\n\nThat token is added to the output sequence.\n\nRepeat until an end-of-sequence token is reached or a max length is hit.\n\nLike temperature, the top-P parameter is also used to control the diversity of the model's output.\n#### Top P\nTop-P defines the probability threshold that, once cumulatively exceeded, tokens stop being selected as candidates. A top-P of 0 is typically equivalent to greedy decoding, and a top-P of 1 typically selects every token in the model's vocabulary.\n\n#### Top K\nYou may also see top-K referenced in LLM literature. Top-K is not configurable in the Gemini 2.0 series of models, but can be changed in older models.

His days were a carefully curated symphony of naps on the warmest spots of the Persian rug, demanding chin scratches from his human, Eleanor, and the occasional strategic swat at a dangling feather toy. Adventure?  Jasper scoffed inwardly. Adventure was for dogs, and squirrels – creatures with questionable judgment.\n\nHowever, even the most steadfastly domestic cat can be swayed by the allure of the unknown.  It started with a moth. A large, clumsy luna moth, its wings the colour of pale jade, fluttering erratically against the windowpane. Jasper, roused from his afternoon slumber, watched with a flicker of predatory interest. He tapped a paw against the glass, then another, a low rumble of curiosity vibrating in his chest.\n\nThen, the impossible happened. Eleanor, bless her absentminded heart, left the back door ajar.  A sliver of the outside world, a tantalising crack in the wall of routine, beckoned. Jasper, usually content within the familiar scent of lavender and Eleanor's baking, felt a prickle of something unfamiliar – an itch beneath his fur, a whisper in the breeze.  He hesitated.  The Persian rug was undeniably comfortable.  But the moth... and the open door…\n\nWith a decisive flick of his tail, Jasper slipped through the gap.\n\nThe world outside was a sensory explosion.  No longer muted by glass, sounds assaulted his sensitive ears: the chirping chorus of unseen birds, the rustle of leaves in a gentle breeze, the distant rumble of a car – a monstrous, metallic beast he’d only ever glimpsed from the safety of the windowsill.  Smells swirled around him, a heady mix of damp earth, blooming roses (Eleanor’s pride and joy, usually forbidden territory), and something wild and untamed, like sunshine warmed on grass.\n\nJasper cautiously ventured into the garden.  The cool damp earth felt strange beneath his paws. He crept low to the ground, a ginger shadow moving through the emerald green of the lawn.  A butterfly, a flash of sapphire and gold, danced past his nose.  He twitched his whiskers, momentarily distracted, before remembering his mission – or rather, his *lack* of mission, which was precisely the point.  He was simply exploring.\n\nHe discovered a hidden world beneath Eleanor’s rose bushes – a cool, shadowy haven where the air smelled of rich soil and decaying leaves.  He stalked a fat bumblebee buzzing lazily around a lavender bush, his hunter instincts momentarily overriding his newfound sense of wonder.  (He didn't catch it, bumblebees were surprisingly nimble).\n\nHe climbed a tree, a scraggly apple tree in the corner of the garden, its bark rough and textured beneath his claws.  From his vantage point, the world stretched out further than he’d ever imagined.  He could see the rooftops of other houses, the glint of something silvery in the distance (a car? A river?  He wasn’t sure, but it was intriguing).  He felt a thrill, a tiny spark of wildness ignite within him.  This wasn't just his garden anymore. This was… something bigger.\n\nHis adventure wasn’t without its perils.  A large, booming bark startled him from his treetop perch. A lumbering brown dog, all wagging tail and clumsy enthusiasm, bounded towards him, tongue lolling. Jasper, fur bristling, hissed and arched his back, a sudden surge of feline fear flooding him.  He scrambled higher into the branches, watching with wary green eyes as the dog sniffed at the base of the tree, then, thankfully, lumbered off in pursuit of a squirrel.\n\nShaken but undeterred, Jasper continued his exploration.  He discovered a patch of wild daisies, their white petals like tiny suns.  He tasted a blade of grass – surprisingly bland.  He even, emboldened by his newfound bravery, ventured beyond the garden fence, into the narrow alleyway behind the houses.\n\nThe alley was a different world entirely.  It smelled of bins and something vaguely fishy.  He saw other cats here, sleek and streetwise, their eyes holding a knowing glint that Jasper, the pampered house cat, couldn't quite decipher.  They eyed him with suspicion, and he, sensing their territoriality, kept his distance.\n\nAs the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and rose, a pang of something unfamiliar tugged at Jasper’s whiskers.  It wasn't fear, not exactly.  It was… longing.  Longing for the familiar warmth of the Persian rug, the gentle rhythm of Eleanor’s breathing, the comforting scent of home.\n\nHe turned and retraced his steps, the alleyway, the garden, the apple tree all now landmarks in his memory.  He found the back door still slightly ajar, a beacon in the gathering dusk. He slipped back inside, unnoticed, as if he'd never left.\n\nEleanor was in the kitchen, humming softly as she prepared dinner.  She didn’t even glance up as Jasper strolled back to his favourite sunbeam on the rug, settling down with a contented sigh.  He purred, a deep rumbling sound that filled the quiet house.\n\nHe was still Jasper, the ginger tabby of discerning taste, the connoisseur of sunbeams. But something had shifted.  The world outside the window wasn't just a hazy blur anymore.  He had smelled it, tasted it, felt it beneath his paws.  He had faced a barking dog, climbed a tree, and even ventured into the mysterious alley.  He had been, for a few glorious hours, an adventurer.\n\nAnd as he drifted off to sleep, dreaming of luna moths and hidden gardens, Jasper knew, with a quiet certainty, that this wouldn’t be his last adventure.  The world was far too interesting to be confined to a Persian rug, no matter how comfortable it was.  The ginger tabby, it seemed, had developed a taste for the unknown.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":41},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*Zero Shot Prompt***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"zero_shot_prompt = \"\"\"Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\nReview: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction\nhumanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,\nunchecked.
